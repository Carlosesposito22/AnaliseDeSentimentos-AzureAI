The rooms were spotless, service was excellent, and the location couldn’t be better—just a short walk from Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey. We had a fantastic time during our visit. The courtyard offered a quiet escape, and we also dined at a nearby Indian restaurant affiliated with the hotel, known for its West Coast seafood and Michelin Star. We chose the tasting menu, which was absolutely delightful. The accommodations were top-notch, featuring a fully equipped kitchen, cozy living area, comfortable bedroom, and a spacious bathroom. Highly recommended!
